# The WeatherTeller

The WeatherTeller is a simple weather application to present Current and Forecast Weather for the next 7 days. 

At first the weather is fetched for the device coordinates, but other cities can be consulted.

## Run Commands

To run the application, we need to open any terminal, command line, or other option and Docker installed on the computer (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Open the terminal, cd (change directory) to the path of the application folder “weather-teller” (e.g. C:\Users\GoncaloSousa\Desktop\WeatherApp\weather-teller)

Use the command _**docker-compose up**_.

The app will start running, when it finishes the build open a browser on _**http://localhost:3001/**_

To stop the application, simply hit CTRL + C or use command _**docker-compose stop**_.

## Docker
The WeatherTeller is an app that runs inside a docker container.

Docker offers many other benefits like encapsulation, isolation, portability, and control.

Docker containers are small, and they start instantly.

Docker can be run on any OS-compatible host (Linux or Windows) that has the Docker runtime installed.
